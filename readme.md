## Google Data Analysis Capstone Project -- Which areas of the U.S. are most accommodating to vegans and vegetarians?

*This readme is an abridged version of this project's full report. See report.pdf to view it in its entirety.*  
  
A common topic of debate in the vegan community is whether or not it is easier for certain communities to adopt healthy, plant-based diets than it is for others. Personally, I think the answer to this question is a no-brainer, but nonetheless was very interested in exploring it with data.  
There are many factors to consider when it comes to transitioning to a new diet, but for this study I have judged how easy it is to be a vegetarian or vegan based on how many restaurants with vegetarian or vegan options are available, as this data is easy to access and eating out at restaurants that often will not accommodate your dietary restrictions is one of the most difficult parts of having a plant-based diet.  
  
  
### Hypothesis
There are more meat-free and plant-based dining options in areas with high levels of income, as well as those with larger populations.

### Methods and Technologies Used
- Data Scraping: Python with Selenium
- Cleaning: PostgreSQL/PGAd4min4, Microsoft Excel
- Exploration/Analysis: Python with numpy, pandas, and scipy
